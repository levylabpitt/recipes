# Device Run: Graphene on AlBN with Ti/Au Contacts

**Date**: 2025-01-10  
**Base Recipe**: [ti-au-standard](../../recipes/graphene-contacts/ti-au-standard.md)  
**Device ID**: 2025-01-10-graphene-albn-ti-au

## Overview

Testing Ti/Au contact recipe on AlBN substrate instead of standard Si/SiO2.

## Key Modification

- **Substrate**: AlBN (modified from standard Si/SiO2)
- **Reason**: This is closer to the actual device structure we want.
